## whut? why? 🌻
- 9 year old niece texted me NY Times Spelling Bee game
- was so fun! 💃
- months later, they semi-paywalled it 🙍‍♀️

---
## how hard could it be?
### what's a pangram?

- small nodeJS app
- pangram "the quick frown box jumps over.."
- hardest part was finding a good word list


---
## words words words
| | |
| ---: | --- |
| 123,195 | ["SCOWL"](http://app.aspell.net/create) word list |
|  38,963 | words (4 letter+ words without `S`) |
|   7,954 | pangrams (words with 7 different letters) |


---
## tactics
- pick letters randomly 🎲
  - until combo makes word with _all 7_ letters
  - use letter frequency when picking
- ban `S`, no `Q` without `U`
- `Q` `J` `Z` not allowed as center letter


---
## OK, just One line of Code
```bash
egrep '^[${letters.join('')}]+$' words.txt
```
find all words with the game's 7 letters 😌


---
## deploy
- webapp is deployed to 🏛️ nomad cluster
- consul healthchecking becomes a "cheap cron"
  - remake game ~4am healthcheck
- everything in one repo/container
  - repeatable "recipe"

## opensource

---
## are you getting fired?
- 1 day for basic game setup
- another 2-3 days for finesse


---
## Less talk, more Play
[Enjoy!](https://word-salad.archive.org/)
